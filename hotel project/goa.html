        Old Goa or Velha Goa which is locally known as Konkani is a historical place in India. Bijapur Sultanate built this city during the 15th century.

        Afterward, during the 16th century, this place served as the Portuguese capital in India. Old Goa is located ten kilometer east from the state capital Panaji and in 1986, UNESCO added some churches and convents of this city as World Heritage Sites in India.
