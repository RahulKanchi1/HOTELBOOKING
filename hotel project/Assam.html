                    Kaziranga National Park is situated in the Golaghat and Nagaon districts of Assam. The national park is famous for the rhino populations, and according to the latest census conducted by the Forest Department of Assam, there are more than 2401 rhinos living in this forest area. If you recall the historical facts then you will get to know about the royal significance of this national park in India.
                Once Mary Curzon, the wife of Lord Curzon visited in this place with her husband and she suddenly identified a rhino in this forest. She requested her husband to protect this place and to stop animal hunting in this national park. Afterward, Lord Curzon protected this place and declared this forest area as a reserved forest in 1916. The Kaziranga National Forest was enlisted as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the year 1985.

Along with some rhinos, you can also find some rare and migratory birds in Kaziranga National Park, like, Asian openbill stork, black bellied tern, delmatian pelican, greater spotted, eastern imperial and lots more. According to etymology, the Kaziranga name was derived from an incident, which happened in nearby villages.

Kazi was a boy and Ranga was a girl who lived in the nearby villages and they fell in love, but the society did not accept their gesture. Afterward, they disappeared in the forest area and never came out of this forest. So the forest was named as Kaziranga as a symbol of their love. So there are multiple myths surrounding this forest.
