        <p>Mahabodhi Vihar in Bodh Gaya, Bihar is literary known as “Great Awakening Temple” where Buddha attained his enlightenment. You can find some depictions of Avalokitesvara, Marichi, Jambhala, Yamantaka and Vajavarathi.

            Along with that, you can also find some rare sculptures of Vishnum Shiva and Surya inside this temple. The famous Bodhi Tree is situated inside the temple complex where Buddha gained enlightenment.
            
            According to popular Buddhist mythology, during 589 BCE, Siddhartha Gautama came to this place and he started meditation under a peepul tree, which is known as the Bodhi tree. After three days, he was enlightened, and afterward, he spent seven succeeding weeks in this forest area.
            
            Later, during the 260 BCE, King Ashoka built this temple in this area. The Bodhi tree is a famous religious point in Bodh Gaya and it is directly connected with the Buddhist history.
            
            According to their mythology no one can travel around the Bodhi tree in this world because this is a sign of the life, and this tree will spread the life to other natural elements of the world from this point.
            
            Apart from this, you can also find a Musical Lake inside the temple complex, which is known as the Mucalinda.
            
            After four weeks of meditation, Buddha found that the firmament was enveloped with dark clouds, and a heavy storm was approaching the earth. After one day, this lake was created automatically and Buddha found his human form after four days.
            
            The temple is designed with brick artwork and this is the oldest brick art in the eastern region. UNESCO added Mahabodhi Temple Complex as World Heritage Site in June, 2002.
